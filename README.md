This package is designed for use as part of a [UDS Software Factory](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-software-factory) bundle deployed on [UDS Core](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-core).

## Optional Dependencies

Renovate requires a version control system (like [`uds-package-gitlab`](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-package-gitlab)) and can be configured to persist it's cache to a Redis/Valkey instance, either in cluster or external. 

For local testing and CI, Renovate is bundled with [uds-package-valkey](ghcr.io/defenseunicorns/packages/uds/uds-package-valkey).

To learn more about how to configure these and other options refer to the [configuration documentation](./docs/configuration.md).

## Releases

The released packages can be found in [ghcr](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-package-renovate/pkgs/container/packages%2Fuds%2Frenovate).

## UDS Tasks (for local dev and CI)

*For local dev, this requires you install [uds-cli](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-cli?tab=readme-ov-file#install)

## Development

When developing this package it is ideal to utilize the json schemas for UDS Bundles, Zarf Packages and Maru Tasks. This involves configuring your IDE to provide schema validation for the respective files used by each application. For guidance on how to set up this schema validation, please refer to the [guide](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-common/blob/main/docs/uds-packages/development/development-ide-configuration.md) in uds-common.
